        <h2  class="containar" >Nature  is the essence of life, providing us with air, water, food, and shelter. Its beauty, seen in trees, rivers, and mountains, brings peace to our minds. However, human actions are harming it. Protecting nature is our duty to ensure a balanced, healthy, and sustainable future for generations to come.</h2>
